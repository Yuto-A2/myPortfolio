                    <p>I have consistently demonstrated a strong commitment to academic excellence, achieving an 80% or higher success rate and being named to the Dean&#39;s List twice. </p>
                    <p>While in Japan, I was dedicated to enhancing my skills as an educator, leading a grade level that had previously performed below the national average to surpass the national benchmark within a year. Now, as I advance my career as a professional engineer, I am continuously refining my skills not only through formal education but also by completing Udemy courses and studying technical literature.</p>
